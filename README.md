# M2-Embedded_Snake

Simple Snake game developed with ATMega328p and LED Matrix.ATMEGA328P is high performance, low power controller from Microchip. ATMEGA328P is an 8-bit microcontroller based on AVR RISC architecture. It is the most popular of all AVR controllers as it is used in ARDUINO boards. It has a modified Harvard architecture 8-bit RISC processor core.ATmega328 is commonly used in many projects and autonomous systems where a simple, low-powered, low-cost micro-controller is needed.
